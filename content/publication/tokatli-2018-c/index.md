abstract: The use of haptic systems in the classroom for enhancing science education is an underexplored area. In the education literature, it has been reported that certain concepts in science education are difficult for students to grasp and, as a result, misconceptions can be formed in the students’ knowledge. We conducted a study with 62 Year 8 (typically 12–13 years old) students who used a haptic application to study cell biology, specifically the concept of diffusion across a cell membrane. The preliminary analysis of the feedback from the students suggests opportunities for haptic applications to enhance their learning, and also highlights a number of points to consider in the design of the application, including the choice of haptic interface and the design of the virtual environment.
