abstract: In the near future, humans and robots are expected to perform collaborative tasks involving physical interaction in various environments, such as homes, hospitals, and factories. Robots are good at precision, strength, and repetition, while humans are better at cognitive tasks. The concept, known as physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), takes advantage of these abilities and is highly beneficial by bringing speed, flexibility, and ergonomics to the execution of complex tasks. Current research in pHRI focuses on designing controllers and developing new methods which offer a better tradeoff between robust stability and high interaction performance. In this paper, we propose a new controller, fractional order admittance controller, for pHRI systems. The stability and transparency analyses of the new control system are performed computationally with human-in-the-loop. Impedance matching is proposed to map fractional order control parameters to integer order ones, and then the stability robustness of the system is studied analytically. Furthermore, the interaction performance is investigated experimentally through two human subject studies involving continuous contact with linear and nonlinear viscoelastic environments. The results indicate that the fractional order admittance controller can be made more robust and transparent than the integer order admittance controller and the use of fractional order term can reduce the human effort during tasks involving contact interactions with environment.
