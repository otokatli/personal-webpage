abstract: Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) integrates the benefits of human operator and a collaborative robot in tasks involving physical interaction, with the aim of increasing the task performance. However, the design of interaction controllers that achieve safe and transparent operations is challenging, mainly due to the contradicting nature of these objectives. Knowing that attaining perfect transparency is practically unachievable, controllers that allow better compromise between these objectives are desirable. In this article, we propose a multicriteria optimization framework, which jointly optimizes the stability robustness and transparency of a closed-loop pHRI system for a given interaction controller. In particular, we propose a Pareto optimization framework that allows the designer to make informed decisions by thoroughly studying the tradeoff between stability robustness and transparency. The proposed framework involves a search over the discretized controller parameter space to compute the Pareto front curve and a selection of controller parameters that yield maximum attainable transparency and stability robustness by studying this tradeoff curve. The proposed framework not only leads to the design of an optimal controller, but also enables a fair comparison among different interaction controllers. In order to demonstrate the practical use of the proposed approach, integer and fractional order admittance controllers are studied as a case study and compared both analytically and experimentally. The experimental results validate the proposed design framework and show that the achievable transparency under fractional order admittance controller is higher than that of integer order one, when both controllers are designed to ensure the same level of stability robustness.
