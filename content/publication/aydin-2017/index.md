abstract: In physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), the cognitive skill of a human is combined with the accuracy, repeatability and strength of a robot. While the promises and potential outcomes of pHRI are glamorous, the control of such coupled systems is challenging in many aspects. In this paper, we propose a new controller, fractional order admittance controller, for pHRI systems. The stability analysis of the new control system with human in-the-loop is performed and the interaction performance is investigated experimentally with 10 subjects during a task imitating a contact with a stiff environment. The results show that the fractional order controller is more robust than the standard admittance controller and helps to reduce the human effort in task execution.
