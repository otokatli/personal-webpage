abstract: For gaining proficiency in physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), it is crucial for engineering students to be provided with the opportunity to physically interact with and gain hands-on experience on design and control of force-feedback robotic devices. We present a single degree of freedom educational robot that features series elastic actuation and relies on closed loop force control to achieve the desired level of safety and transparency during physical interactions. The proposed device complements the existing impedance-type Haptic Paddle designs by demonstrating the challenges involved in the synergistic design and control of admittance-type devices. We present integration of this device into pHRI education, by providing guidelines for the use of the device to allow students to experience the performance trade-offs inherent in force control systems, due to the non-collocation between the force sensor and the actuator. These exercises enable students to modify the mechanical design in addition to the controllers, by assigning different levels of stiffness values to the compliant element, and characterize the effects of these design choices on the closed-loop force control performance of the device. We also report initial evaluations of the efficacy of the device for pHRI studies.
